How to pitch website design to a company

Our job at Sebstrone is to create websites that are ideal for our clients and audiences. It is a systematic process that takes place through which it became possible.  However we mean it and understand this, the clients don’t know what we know. Sometimes they get afraid that they will not be able to accurately describe to us what they want exactly. Sebstrone is a result-oriented website design company in texas. We create powerful and stunning websites.



The important thing is that 9 out of 10 times, clients are over-thinking and confused about things. But we don’t want them to speak about our language. And, we don’t expect them too. Sebstrone is an award-winning professional web design company in Houston that focuses on lead generation and website design company in Houston to grow your business online. What in reality we need is the website’s story of success. So what might you need from your web design agency? 

How do you tell a website design company about your requirements?
Understand the need of why. Know the goal of what you want to ask:

Need a New Website? No, you need a new and fresh website that does XXX for YYY. 
Need changes to your website? No, you need it to do XXX for YYY, because of ZZZ. 
Need more traffic? No, you need better traffic. 
Need more conversions? No, you need to get out of their way. 

Our intention from above points is to have a better and more productive relationship with your web design company… and how this relationship turns into lots of money, contacts, awareness, whatever the goal might be. Sebstrone is an award-winning professional website design company in Kansas city that focuses on lead generation and website design company in Houston to grow your business online. 

If you want to know the website’s story of success, so what you need from your website design vendor, Here are some possibilities: 

A completely new website
An update/new functionality for your website.
Increased traffic to your website
A better conversion rate for your website. 

It is looking simple. Now. let’s break this out into what we often hear related to these needs:

“I need a new website”
“I need a couple of changes made to my website”
“My seo is terrible, I need more traffic.”
“I have great traffic, but no one contacts me.”

And these are almost inevitably followed by “how much?” and/or “how long?” See the problem. How can we decide possible estimated cost or time without more details? We can't, that's why we need more info.

But what? What website design company exactly needs you?
Hopefully this breakdown will help improve your communications with your web designer..
Completely new Website
A website can be anything from a one page simple site all the way to a database driven, responsive website, with website service calls, localization, and on and on. There is a big middle area and chances are your new site falls in there somewhere. 

Updates to your website
Simple edits aside, I’m really referring to major updates to your existing website. For these, what we really need to know is the why. Not because you need to convince us to make the update, but because we need to convince us to make the update, but because we need to understand what the goals are in order to come up with the best solution.

Increased Traffic to Your Website
What we are really talking about here is SEO and ultimately content marketing. We gets lots of requests for better traffic. But, what does that really mean? Are you looking to simply increase the numbers? You might think so but I would caution against this. You don’t just want visitors, you want the right kind of visitors. You want potential clients.
You have lots of traffic but less conversion
What we are dealing with here is called conversion, or a lack thereof. Conversion means that someone saw a call to action on your site and acted on it.
